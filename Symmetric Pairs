First, create a table, CTE which each row in the table is assigned a unique number using the ROW_NUMBER() function.
Then, performe self join on the CTE to match the rows where X and Y are symmetric.
The f1.rn != f2.rn condition ensures that the same row is not matched with itself, which would lead to false positive results.

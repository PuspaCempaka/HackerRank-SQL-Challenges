/*
The idea is to create a table only contain of P and P is not null.
To delete the duplicate, we create new variable called cnt in this table.
Create a new column (cat) which:
- N with P is Null is categorized as "Root"
- N that not have the same value with P1 in the new table is categorized as "Leaf"
- else will be categorized as "Inner"
*/

WITH Table1 AS

SELECT N,

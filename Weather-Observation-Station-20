First, count the length of data, n=499 is the odd number.
Since it is the odd number, the median is the data in (n+1)/2 = 250
then, create a table that sorts the Lat_N data from the smallest to the largest and creates a new column as the row id.
Note: This formula might not work for data that the length is an even number.
